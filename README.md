# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
  - I built a website that allows a user to choose a randomly generated message. The message can be a positive affirmation or mantra. The idea is for a user to get some positivity when they may need some self care in their life.
  - A lot of people don't always hear positive messages so this application is looking to give those messages to those who may need it.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
  - They can fork this repo and clone it to their machine on terminal using "git clone." They can then open it in a text editor and open the index either by typing "open index.html" or going here file:///Users/joshuapierce/2208-mod1/projects/self-care-center/index.html.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
  - This project has been assigned to me in week three of Turing. This took me 4 separate sessions between Wednesday and Sunday for a total of about 12 hours of work.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
  - Joshua Pierce: https://github.com/JPierce28

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
  - Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
  - Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
  - Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
## Wins
  - Being able to write new HTML is a big win for me. So far in turing I've had a difficulty with HTML and in this project I was able to fully design the initial layout using CSS and HTML only.
  - Another win was my abitily to update the data model using JavaScript while also updating the DOM. This project I was a lot more confident coding and designing the webpage.

## Challenges 
  - A big challenge for me is finding a way to have certain features hidden on page load and have them reval when a function is implemented.
  - A challenge I faced was learning how to use flex boxes and the implementation of different tables. Getting the data where I wanted it initially was very challenging.
